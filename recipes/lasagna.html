    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made from layers of pasta sheets,
      alternating with fillings such as ragù (meat sauce), cheese, and béchamel
      sauce. It's baked until bubbly and golden, offering a harmonious blend of
      flavors and textures. Lasagna can vary in its ingredients and can also be

      <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions
        and minced garlic, sautéing until translucent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the ground beef or pork to the skillet and cook until browned. Drain
        excess fat if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce, and if using, the red
        wine. Season with salt, pepper, and dried Italian herbs or oregano. Let
        the sauce simmer for about 20-30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese with a handful of
        grated Parmesan and some chopped basil. Season with a pinch of salt and
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the béchamel sauce in another pot by melting butter, adding
        flour to make a roux, and gradually whisking in the milk until smooth.
        Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. Cook until thickened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Boil the lasagna noodles according to package instructions until al
        dente, then drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Begin layering the lasagna in a baking dish. Start with a layer of meat
        sauce at the bottom, followed by a layer of lasagna noodles. Spread a
        layer of the ricotta mixture, then some béchamel sauce, and sprinkle a
        layer of mozzarella cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat the layering process until all ingredients are used up, finishing
        with a layer of meat sauce, béchamel, and a generous sprinkle of both
        mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 30-40
        minutes or until the lasagna is bubbly and the top is golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once done, remove from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes to set.

      <li>
        Garnish with fresh parsley and additional grated Parmesan if desired.
